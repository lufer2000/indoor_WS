# indor_WS

This project is very simple, having only three components:

- NodeMCU with ESP8266;
- OLED 0.96'';
- DHT22 sensor.
This system allows, through the DHT22, to measure the temperature inside a house, as well as the value of relative humidity. However, and as a challenge for me, I added two more processes:

-Send all data to the Thinskpeak platform;
-Collect weather data abroad, through the OpenWeatherMap platform, as well as the forecast for the following three days.
